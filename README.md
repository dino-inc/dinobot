# A general purpose discord bot for Samsara

Want to run the bot? You'll need to have a file named "token.txt" with the bot token you wish to run the bot on. 
While I've made an attempt to make the bot less customized for a single server, you'll likely need to strip out some server-specific IDs to restore full functionality. Good luck!
